Class-STL-Containers version 0.34
=================================

These modules provide object container management with a framework similar to STL 
(Standard Template Library from C++).  The usual container types are provided (list, 
vector, deque, queue, stack, priority_queue and also, tree) together with various 
algorithms (find_if, remove_if, for_each, etc), utilities (bind1st, bind2nd, ptr_fun, mem_fun, etc),
 and an iterator type. Also included is a comprehensive class producer which can be used 
to generate the class code for the main member functions including the constructor, 
data member accessor functions, clone, swap, copy constructor, and also has the facility 
to produce a singleton type class, thus making this package usefull to get up and going 
quickly with Perl OO program development. 

Please view the tests for extensive examples.
